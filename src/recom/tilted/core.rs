//! Shared engine for tilted-run ReCom optimizers.
//!
//! A tilted run is a continuous Markov chain that always accepts plans with
//! better scores and accepts plans with worse scores according to a pluggable
//! [`AcceptanceRule`]. The two acceptance rules currently provided live in
//! sibling modules: `fixed::FixedAcceptance` accepts a worse plan with a fixed
//! probability, and `metropolis::MetropolisAcceptance` accepts a worse plan
//! with probability `exp(beta * delta)` where `delta` is signed by the
//! optimization direction. Unlike short bursts, there is no burst boundary
//! and no resetting to a global best state.
//!
//! Threading follows the same model as `multi_chain` in `run.rs`: worker
//! threads parallelize the tree-drawing step within a single sequential
//! tilted chain. Workers draw trees, score proposals, and decide accept/reject;
//! the main thread interleaves accepted proposals and rejections. Optional
//! output writers run on separate threads fed by bounded channels, so disk I/O
//! and serialization usually do not block proposal generation; the bound only
//! engages if a writer falls persistently behind the chain.
//!
//! See `docs/tilted_runs_spec.md` for full architecture documentation.
