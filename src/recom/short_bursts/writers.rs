/// Starts a chain-statistics writer thread.
///
/// Short-bursts emits a full partition on every output record (the runner
/// already pays the partition clone in both `write_best_only` modes), so the
/// writer thread receives partitions directly and synthesizes an empty
/// proposal on each `writer.step` call. Writers that need proposal-level data
/// (TSV, JSONL, pcompress) will see empty/zeroed proposal fields; prefer the
/// `assignments`, `canonicalized-assignments`, `canonical`, or `ben` writers
/// when running short bursts.
///
/// # Arguments
///
/// * `graph` - Graph passed to `writer.step` for context.
/// * `partition` - Writer-owned starting partition; `init` is called against it.
/// * `writer` - Stats writer receiving accepted partitions.
/// * `recv` - Channel receiving asynchronous stats write packets.
